BioBatch
=======

BioBatch is a simple batch processing system written in BASH. It hasn't been looked at for a number of years.
It was built to serve a purpose during my PhD and worked very well, but may not perform as expected with many systems.
With a bit of work I'm confident it can work well, although it is not as fully featured as many other solutions.

Requirements
------------
BioBatch is designed to be as minimal as possible requiring only:
* BASH
* cron
* at

The install script has a good bash (no pun intended) at setting BioBatch up,
but there are probably several hurdles that could trip it up. By all means
give it a go, but if it fails it is straightforward to follow the steps in the
install script manually.
