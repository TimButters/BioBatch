BioBatch
=======

BioBatch is a simple batch processing system written in BASH. It hasn't been looked at for a number of years.
It was built to serve a purpose during my PhD and worked very well, but may not perform as expected with many systems.
With a bit of work I'm confident it can work well, although it is not as fully featured as many other solutions.
